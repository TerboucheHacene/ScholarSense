ABOUT = """
# About
ScholarSense is a tool that helps you find relevant papers to read based on your interests.
It uses a [Sentence Transformer Model](https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/SentenceTransformer.html#) Or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings) to calculate the similarity between your query and the papers' abstracts.
The similarity is calculated using the cosine similarity between the embeddings of the query and the abstracts.
